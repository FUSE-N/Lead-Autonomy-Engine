Yes—this is both **recommended** and **correct** for the type of platform Leads.ai is becoming. Below is the precise, implementation-ready definition.

---

## Fixed Sidebar with Independent Page Scrolling

### Objective

Ensure the sidebar remains **fully fixed and visible at all times**, while only the main content area scrolls vertically. This preserves orientation, improves efficiency, and reinforces Leads.ai as an executive-grade control system.

---

## Core Behavior Definition

### Sidebar (Fixed)

* **Position:** Fixed (or sticky with full viewport height)
* **Height:** 100vh (full viewport height)
* **Behavior on Scroll:**

  * Does **not move**
  * Does **not scroll**
* **Contents Always Visible:**

  * Logo
  * Collapse / expand button (right of logo)
  * Navigation icons / labels

The sidebar functions as a **permanent control rail**.

---

### Main Content Area (Scrollable)

* All pages (Command Center, Campaigns, Automation, Insights, etc.) scroll **independently** of the sidebar.
* Vertical scrolling affects **only**:

  * Page body
  * Cards
  * Tables
  * Analytics
* Header (top bar) may be:

  * Sticky (recommended), or
  * Static (acceptable)

---

## Layout Architecture (Conceptual)

```
| Sidebar (fixed) |  Main Content (scrollable) |
|                 |  ┌──────────────────────┐ |
|  Logo   ◀       |  | Header / Toolbar     | |
|  Nav Items      |  ├──────────────────────┤ |
|                 |  | Page Content         | |
|                 |  | (scrolls vertically) | |
|                 |  |                      | |
```

---

## Collapsed Sidebar Behavior (Still Fixed)

* When collapsed:

  * Sidebar remains fixed
  * Width reduces
  * Icons remain visible
* Main content automatically expands to use freed space
* Scrolling behavior remains unchanged

---

## UX Advantages

This approach ensures:

* Zero loss of navigation context
* Faster switching between pages
* No accidental disorientation during long scrolls
* Cleaner mental model for users

It also aligns Leads.ai with best-in-class platforms such as:

* Notion
* Linear
* Stripe Dashboard
* GitHub

---

## Accessibility & Performance Notes

* Sidebar should not trap scroll focus
* Keyboard navigation remains uninterrupted
* Avoid nested scrollbars inside the sidebar
* Use smooth transitions for collapse/expand only

---

## Final UX Principle

> **Navigation is fixed. Execution scrolls.**

This principle is now consistent across Leads.ai.

### Recommended Next Step

If you approve, the next steps would be:

* Define header (top bar) sticky vs static behavior
* Specify responsive behavior for tablets and mobile
* Create layout constraints for frontend implementation
* Translate into a **developer-ready layout spec**
