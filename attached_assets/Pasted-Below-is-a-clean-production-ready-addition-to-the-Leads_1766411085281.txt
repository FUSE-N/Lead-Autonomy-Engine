Below is a clean, production-ready addition to the **Leads.ai** interaction model, extending the Command Center input experience while preserving simplicity and power.

---

## 8. Multimodal Command Input: File Upload & Voice Transcription

### Objective

Allow users to communicate with Leads.ai in multiple natural formats—text, documents, images, and voice—so the platform can extract intent, context, and data automatically.

---

### UI Enhancement: Command Textbox (Primary Input Field)

**Location:**

* Central Command Center textbox (global input field)

**New Icons Added Inside the Textbox (Right-Aligned):**

* 📎 **Upload Icon**
* 🎙 **Microphone Icon**

---

## 8.1 File Upload Capability (📎 Upload Icon)

### Supported File Types

* **Documents:** PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT
* **Images:** PNG, JPG, JPEG
* (Extensible to CSV, XLSX in later phases)

### User Flow

1. User clicks the **Upload icon**
2. File picker opens
3. Uploaded file appears as a chip/preview inside the textbox
4. User enters or selects an action prompt, e.g.:

   > “Extract leads from this document and start outreach”
5. Leads.ai automatically:

   * Parses and reads the file
   * Extracts relevant information (text, tables, images)
   * Infers intent and proposes next actions

### AI Processing Behavior

* **PDF/DOC:** Content extraction, summarization, entity detection
* **Images:** OCR + semantic interpretation
* **Cross-reference:** Combines uploaded content with user’s existing campaigns and leads

### Value

* Eliminates manual copy-paste
* Enables document-driven workflows
* Supports real-world business inputs (pitch decks, reports, lead lists)

## 8.2 Voice Input & Audio Transcription (🎙 Microphone Icon)

### Functionality

* Users can record voice commands directly within the textbox
* Real-time waveform or recording indicator appears
* One-tap start / stop recording

### Processing Pipeline

1. Audio is recorded securely
2. Speech-to-text transcription occurs automatically
3. Transcribed text appears in the textbox for review
4. User can edit or submit immediately

### Intelligent Enhancements

* Language auto-detection
* Punctuation and formatting
* Intent recognition from conversational speech

### Example Use Case

> “Find e-commerce brands in the UK and generate LinkedIn outreach messages”

Leads.ai converts this into structured execution tasks without requiring typing.

### Value

* Increases accessibility
* Accelerates ideation and command execution
* Enables hands-free operation for busy users

---

## 9. Unified Multimodal Intelligence

Once files or voice input are added, Leads.ai treats them as **contextual memory** for the current task:

* Uploaded files are linked to the resulting Leads Folder
* Transcriptions are stored alongside campaign instructions
* Users can reference previous uploads or recordings in follow-up commands

This ensures continuity, traceability, and auditability across campaigns.

---

## Strategic Outcome

With this enhancement, the Command Center becomes:

* A **multimodal AI console**
* A **single source of truth** for instructions, assets, and intent
* A frictionless interface for both technical and non-technical users

Leads.ai now supports:

> *Type it. Upload it. Say it. Execute it.*

---

### Recommended Next Step

If you wish, the next step would be to:

* Define **error states & file size limits**
* Design **upload previews and transcription UI states**
* Specify **backend processing flow (OCR, ASR, parsing)**
* Or convert this into a **developer-ready UI/UX specification**

Please indicate how you would like to proceed.
