## Proposed Feature Enhancements for Leads.ai

### 1. Social Media Handles & Account Linking (Settings Module)

**Objective:**
Enable users to centrally manage their brand’s social presence and allow the platform to act autonomously on their behalf.

**Key Capabilities:**

* Users can securely link multiple social media accounts from the **Settings** panel, including:

  * Facebook (Pages & Groups)
  * Instagram
  * X (Twitter)
  * LinkedIn (Personal & Company Pages)
  * TikTok
* OAuth-based authentication to ensure privacy, security, and revocable access.
* Ability to select default platforms for posting or campaign execution.

**Value:**

* Eliminates repetitive manual posting.
* Positions Leads.ai as a true “command-and-execute” system rather than a suggestion-only AI.

### 2. AI-Generated Social Media Content with One-Click Publishing

**Objective:**
Transform campaign intent into ready-to-publish social media content with minimal user effort.

**Workflow:**

1. User describes a product, offer, or campaign goal in natural language.
2. Leads.ai automatically:

   * Generates platform-optimized posts (tone, length, hashtags, emojis, CTA).
   * Adapts content per platform (e.g., LinkedIn professional tone vs. Instagram promotional tone).
3. User can:

   * Preview posts per platform.
   * Edit if desired.
   * Click **“Share to All Linked Accounts”** or selectively post to chosen platforms.

**Advanced Options (Optional / Phase 2):**

* Auto-scheduling (best posting time per platform).
* A/B content variants.
* Engagement-driven content refinement (learning from likes, shares, CTR).

**Value:**

* Dramatically reduces time-to-market for campaigns.
* Enables non-marketers to execute professional-grade social strategies.

### 3. Command Center Enhancement: “Leads Folder” System (Sidebar)

**Objective:**
Create a persistent, organized execution memory for all lead-generation tasks initiated by the user.

**Sidebar Addition (Under Command Center):**
**📁 Leads Library / Leads Folders**

**Functionality:**

* Automatically creates folders for:

  * Campaign-based leads
  * Platform-specific leads (Email, LinkedIn, Cold Outreach, Social)
  * Custom user-defined lead requests
* Each folder stores:

  * Lead source
  * AI-generated messaging
  * Execution status (Pending, Running, Completed)
  * Performance metrics (responses, conversions)
  * Any follow-up tasks initiated by the AI

**Example Use Case:**

> “Find 500 SaaS founders in Germany and start LinkedIn outreach.”

Leads.ai will:

* Execute the task.
* Store all results, messages, and progress inside a dedicated **Leads Folder**.
* Allow the user to revisit, expand, or rerun the task later.

**Value:**

* Prevents loss of context across multiple campaigns.
* Enables long-term lead asset accumulation.
* Supports scalable and repeatable growth workflows.

### 4. Strategic Impact on Leads.ai Positioning

With these additions, Leads.ai evolves into:

* An **AI-powered social growth engine**
* A **centralized outreach and publishing hub**
* A **persistent execution memory system for leads**

This clearly differentiates the platform from:

* Basic social media schedulers
* One-off AI content generators
* CRM tools without autonomous execution

---

### Optional Next Step (Recommended)

If you would like, the next logical progression would be to:

* Redesign the **Sidebar Navigation Structure**
* Define the **Settings → Social Accounts UI**
* Specify the **Data Model for Leads Folders**
* Or convert this into a **product requirement document (PRD)** for developers and investors

Please indicate how you would like to proceed.
