Below is a precise and UI-ready enhancement to the **Leads.ai navigation system**, aligned with the clean, executive experience we have been defining.

---

## 6. Collapsible Sidebar (Tab Bar) Enhancement

### Objective

Give users full control over screen real estate while maintaining fast access to platform navigation.

---

## Sidebar Behavior & Control

### Placement of Collapse Control

* A **collapse / expand button** is placed **immediately to the right of the logo icon** at the top of the sidebar.
* The button is visually subtle but clearly discoverable.
* Recommended iconography:

  * Collapsed state: ▶ (or chevron-right)
  * Expanded state: ◀ (or chevron-left)

---

## Sidebar States

### 1. Expanded State (Default)

* Full-width sidebar
* Displays:

  * Logo
  * Navigation labels (Command Center, Campaigns, Automation, Insights, Leads Library, etc.)
  * Section dividers where appropriate
* Ideal for first-time users and exploration

---

### 2. Collapsed State

* Sidebar reduces to a slim vertical bar
* Displays:

  * Logo (icon-only)
  * Navigation icons only
* On hover:

  * Tooltip reveals full page name
* On click:

  * Navigates instantly without expanding

**Behavioral Notes:**

* The collapse state persists across sessions (saved per user)
* Smooth animation (150–250ms) for premium feel

---

## Interaction Details

* Clicking the button:

  * Toggles between expanded and collapsed states
* Keyboard accessibility:

  * Shortcut (e.g., `Ctrl + B`) for power users
* Responsive logic:

  * Auto-collapses on smaller screens
  * Manual override always respected

---

## UX & Strategic Impact

This enhancement:

* Reduces cognitive load
* Maximizes workspace for the Command Center and campaigns
* Supports both exploratory and focused work modes
* Aligns Leads.ai with modern enterprise-grade platforms (e.g., Notion, Linear, GitHub)

## Visual Hierarchy Summary

```
[ Logo ] [ ◀ ]     ← Collapse / Expand Button
-----------------
| Command Center |
| Campaigns      |
| Automation     |
| Insights       |
| Leads Library  |
| Agent Activity |
| Performance    |
-----------------
```

## Final Result

With this change, Leads.ai navigation becomes:

* Minimal when needed
* Informative when expanded
* User-controlled at all times

This completes the foundational UX system for Leads.ai.
